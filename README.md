# My .vimrc file

While I doubt anyone will find any great Vim pearls of wisdom from this, one thing that might be immediately useful to others is how I have this setup in Windows.

- Vim Installation: ``C:\Vim``
- .vim folder: ``%USERPROFILE%\.vim``
- Contents of ``%USERPROFILE\_vimrc``:`source ~/.vim/.vimrc`

Plugin files, sessions, swapfiles, etc should all be found in the .vim folder.

This is  very OS compatible and a light solution to get a version controlled .vim folder in Windows.
